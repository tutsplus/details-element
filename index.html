					<summary>What is HTML5?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>HTML5 contains powerful capabilities for Web-based applications with more powerful interaction, video support, graphics, more styling effects, and a full set of APIs. HTML5 adapts to any device, whether desktop, mobile, tablet, or television. HTML5 is an open platform developed under royalty free licensing terms.</p>

						<p>People use the term HTML5 in two ways:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>to refer to a set of technologies that together form the future Open Web Platform. These technologies include HTML5 specification, CSS3, SVG, MathML, Geolocation, XmlHttpRequest, Context 2D, Web Fonts (WOFF) and others. The boundary of this set of technologies is informal and changes over time.</li>
							<li>to refer to the HTML5 specification, which is, of course, also part of the Open Web Platform.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>Although it would be great if people used one term to refer to the specification and another term to refer to set of specifications, in practice people use the term both ways.
						</p>
					</div>
					<details>
						<summary>Note:</summary>
						<div class="detail-content">
							<p>Throughout this FAQ, we use HTML5 to refer only to the HTML5 specification. We use Open Web Platform to refer to the larger set of technologies.</p>
						</div>

					<summary>Why is HTML5 so exciting?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>There is huge demand for open standards that allow the creation of rich internet applications. Watching videos, finding the nearest restaurant, accessing emails while being offline are just some of the powerful new capabilities enabled by the set of specifications in development at W3C.</p>

						<p>One aspect that interests W3C in particular is enabling people to combine different technologies. W3C works to ensure not just interoperable support in software of a single specification, but compatibility among specifications.</p>

						<p>Even though HTML5 is still a draft, browser vendors are deploying features and generating a lot of excitement in the IT industry. This experience in turn allows W3C to revise its drafts. In this way, the final standard can transparently inform implementers where they need to pay close attention to security and privacy issues.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>When can I use HTML5?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>People can already use parts of the platform that interoperate, but W3C's mission is global interoperable, to ensure that the web is available to all. Not all elements are fully implemented yet and some of them provide builtin fallback mechanisms, such as <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. One can use HTML5 today, knowing the existing limitations and ensuring proper fallbacks.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Which Web browsers support HTML5?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>W3C encourages implementation and testing long before a specification becomes a standard to ensure that two people can read a specification independently and write interoperable software. Early adopters provide implementers and W3C with tremendously valuable feedback because they help identify where interoperability issues exist. For a more detailed understanding of what is currently supported, please see the HTML5 Test <a href="http://test.w3.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm">Suite Conformance Results</a> (a work in progress).</p>

						<p>A number of people are tracking browser implementations (e.g., <a href="http://html5readiness.com/">html5readiness</a>). Note: W3C has not verified the accuracy of these reports.</p>

					<summary>What are HTML5 Security and Privacy Issues?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>Now entering its third decade, the Web has evolved from a Web of documents into a formidable platform for networked applications that let us share information and services over the Internet. In this highly connected environment, it is important that powerful Web applications be designed with sensitivity to user privacy and security needs. The risks associated with modern Web applications are familiar to the HTML5 community.</p>

						<p>HTML5 and related specifications are being developed in W3C's open standards process. This process allow expert review of features along with their security and privacy implications. Rich functionality that was previously available only through proprietary plugins is now documented in an open specification for all experts to review and improve. We're pleased to see the HTML5 specifications subject to rigorous public review, since that helps make the Web a more secure environment.</p>

						<p>Some security issues are not confined to HTML5. W3C and IETF are working closely to specify technologies and protocol extensions to mitigate some issues (such as cross-site request forgery and cross- site scripting).</p>

					<summary>What happens to XHTML?</summary>
					<div class="detail-content">
						<p>The HTML5 specification defines two syntaxes, an HTML syntax and an XHTML syntax. The HTML syntax is intended to be served using the <code>text/html</code> media type. The XHTML syntax is intended to be served using the <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> media type. The Polyglot Markup: HTML-Compatible XHTML Documents specification (a work in progress) describes documents that conform to both syntaxes and can therefore be served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> or <code>text/html</code>.</p>
